## Portfolio

### Main
Development and maintenance of front end library for ibm.com (three major versions) plus related consulting, integration and devops. Library itself resembles bootstrap-like assets (html patters, css, js, icons). Integration and consulting activities were mainly about helping other teams within IBM to integrate our library into various projects with different stacks (from basic static html pages to React based app). I also developped a number of tools to make integration of our internal library easier (boilerplates, skeleton applications, tools). Beyond this, I actively worked with developers and maintained community within IBM with purpose of knowledge sharing. I've have experience with project management (people, budgets, technical things) although I preffer development and reasearch. Alongside my daily job at IBM I worked as "CSS guy" for number of companies on all sorts of projects. You can find few examples in following section.
