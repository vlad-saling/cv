## Overview


            <p>My daily job is development and maintenance of front end library for ibm.com (three major versions) plus related consulting,
                    integration and devops. Library itself resembles bootstrap-like assets (html patterns, css, js, icons). Consulting
                    is related to integration of said library into various projects with different stacks (from basic static html pages to React based apps). I also developed a number of tools
                    to make integration of our internal library easier (boilerplates, skeleton applications, tools).</p>
    
                <p>Beyond what's mentioned above I actively work with developers and maintained local community within IBM with
                    purpose of knowledge sharing. I also have experience with project management. During my freelance acitivities I work as "CSS guy" for
                    number of companies on all sorts of projects. </p>
