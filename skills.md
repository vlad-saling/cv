## Overview

My speciality is architecture and development of static front end meaning CSS and HTML. However, in last couple of years I started to dive deeper into JavaScript and surrounding ecosystem (Node, Electron, Npm, taskrunners.). I've gained - at least basic - knowledge of most of the popular frameworks out there and I would not hesitate to learn a new one. Thanks to my formal education I have broad knowledge of IT. I also have some exprience in artistic fields of IT like 3D and 2D design, although nowadays it's more of a hobby. 

Note: I am not a coding demon. I wont spit out entire codebase in an hour. I do keep my due dates (if they are reasonable), however I preffer to experiment, research and explore various approaches to find best possible option.
